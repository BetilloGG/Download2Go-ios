/*!
 *  @abstract AVURLAsset wrapper for StreamAssured playback.
 *
 *  @discussion: Provides a mechanism for StreamAssured players to track player progress for analytic reporting.
 *
 *  StreamAssured players will use StreamAssuredAVURLAsset before playback starts, calling replaceCurrentItemWithPlayerItem with an AVPlayerItem constructed with a StreamAssuredAVURLAsset to start progress tracking.  If you invoke a new AVPlayer instance (after the player stalls, for example) you must use the same StreamAssuredAVURLAsset instance to properly continue player progress tracking.
 *
 *  IMPORTANT: StreamAssured players must call replaceCurrentItemWithPlayerItem with nil when playback stops.  Otherwise player progress analytics will not be triggered.
